# Reloop-RP-8000-MIDI

Proof of concept of updating the tempo on the LCD screen on the Reloop RP-8000 and Reloop RP-8000 MK2 DJ turntables

## Goals

* Further reverse engieer the RP-8000. How much control is available through MIDI SysEx? How much control is possible through firmware? How do we know what we don't know?

* Extract individual deck tempo from Traktor

* Create a full mapping interface into Mixxx

* Decode the time elapsed / time remaining SysEx update messages for MK2

* Decode any other SysEx messages the RP-8000 is sending or receiving

## Updates

MIDI/SysEx updates will be pushed here. I'll also have a RP-8000 page on the Mixxx hardware wiki detailing my findings

## Acknowledgements

Shouts to Bavi_H for helping with the bitwise maths!
